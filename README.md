# Task-3-Password-Complexity-Checker
The Password Complexity Checker is a Python script designed to evaluate the strength of a password based on several predefined security criteria. It provides feedback to users on how they can improve their password security.
# How It Works
1. Takes User Input – The script prompts the user to enter a password.
2. Evaluates Strength Based on Criteria:
- Length: Minimum 8 characters required.
- Uppercase Letter: At least one uppercase character.
- Lowercase Letter: At least one lowercase character.
- Digit: At least one numerical digit.
- Special Character: At least one symbol (e.g., !@#$%^&*()).
3. Assigns a Strength Level – The script categorizes the password as:
- Very Weak
- Weak
-Moderate
- Strong
- Very Strong
- Excellent
4. Provides Feedback – If any criteria are missing, the script suggests improvements.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage
1. Run the script using `python script.py`.
2. Enter a password when prompted.
3. The tool will assess its strength and provide improvement suggestions if needed.

# Why This Matters
A strong password reduces the risk of unauthorized access and password cracking attacks, such as brute force and dictionary attacks. By following the feedback, users can create more secure passwords.
